# Stroke-Prediction-System
This Stroke Prediction System is a web app that uses machine learning (Logistic Regression) to predict the risk of stroke based on patient health data. Built with Python and Streamlit, it offers a simple interface for real-time stroke risk assessment using clinical and lifestyle inputs.

# 🧠 Stroke Prediction System

This is a machine learning–based web app that predicts the risk of stroke based on patient health data. The app uses a **Logistic Regression** model and is built with **Python**, **pandas**, **scikit-learn**, and **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features
- Predicts stroke risk using real patient inputs
- Real-time probability score
- Clean and interactive UI with Streamlit
- Trained on a public healthcare dataset

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle – Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset)
- Features include age, hypertension, heart disease, BMI, glucose level, smoking status, etc.
